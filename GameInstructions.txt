On the screen, the moving elements are particles, which come in 7 colors corresponding to 7 different masses (red being the heaviest, purple the lightest).

On the left side is the control bar. Clicking or using the up and down arrow keys can switch between the following options:
"Mass", "Angle", "Particle Color", "Mode"
Each option has several selectable values. The mouse wheel or left and right arrow keys can be used to switch between values. Different combinations of values for these 4 options can produce different effects when using the left mouse button. The effect with the right mouse button is the opposite.

The "Mode" has 3 values: "Gravity," "Particles," and "Barrier." Different options correspond to different effects when the mouse button is pressed.

The size of the "Mass" affects the strength of gravity in "Gravity" mode and the particle generation speed and deletion range (right-click) in "Particles" mode. The size of the "Angle" affects the angle of gravity in "Gravity" mode. The value of "Particle" affects the color of the particles generated and deleted in "Particles" mode.

In addition to the mouse, you can use the following keys to affect the particles:
Pressing the q or z key creates particles.
Pressing the w or x key deletes particles (not affected by the "Particle" option).
Pressing the s key deletes all objects.
Pressing the number keys 0 to 7 changes the mass (color) of all particles.
Pressing the a key decelerates particles.
Pressing the b key accelerates particles.
Pressing the c key stops particles.
Pressing the d key makes particles move at high speed.
Pressing the e key smashes things!
Pressing the f key reverses time!

Right-clicking on the control bar options or pressing the space bar restores default values.
